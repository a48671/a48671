## About me
Hello. I have been doing commercial development since 2015. For the last 3 years and 7 months, I have been working in the FinTech sector (Bank Tochka). I develop both microservices for the online bank and internal CRM systems for the bank's employees. I have the most experience with React (TypeScript) and its ecosystem. However, I am confident that mastering any technology will not take much time with a solid understanding of the basics. I would be interested in trying webassembly, and I've even looked into Rust. But since it's not in demand at my current job, I haven't been able to develop in this direction yet.

I actively seek opportunities to enhance both technical and interpersonal skills. Committed to staying abreast of industry trends and technological advancements to drive innovation and maintain a competitive edge in frontend development. I am often passionate about contemplating and designing robust software architecture. I enjoy thoroughly considering the intricacies of solutions I've implemented, aiming to continuously refine and enhance project outcomes through strategic architectural planning and execution.

I have a keen interest in researching and experimenting with programming approaches without relying on frameworks. This pursuit, undertaken for personal enjoyment, provides me with a deeper understanding of fundamental programming concepts and principles, enhancing my overall skills and knowledge base.

I have a long time of experience working remotely, so I am capable of organizing and managing work processes effectively in a remote setting when required, ensuring productivity and adherence to project timelines. However, I value the opportunity to work on-site, appreciating the collaborative and dynamic environment that an office provides.

I am  also ambitious and forward-looking, with a keen interest in evolving into a Tech or Team Leader role. Eager to embrace opportunities for growth in this area, leveraging my extensive frontend development experience and collaborative skills to inspire teams and drive projects to success.

As an experienced developer, I've encountered and successfully overcome periods of burnout. This experience has equipped me with the knowledge and strategies necessary to maintain a healthy work-life balance, ensuring sustained productivity and well-being over the long term. I'm adept at organizing my workload and personal life to prevent burnout, demonstrating resilience and a proactive approach to professional challenges.

I currently reside in Turkey (almost three years), but I am very interested in relocating to New Zealand or Australia.
